Discuss some basic knowledge about how SSH works.

## public/private keys 

Q: what’s the public/private key for SSH?

A: 

You're asking a fundamental question about how SSH (Secure Shell) works, and it's a great one to understand\! The concept of public and private keys is at the heart of secure communication on the internet.

Imagine you want to send a secret message to someone, and you want to be sure only they can read it, and they want to be sure it truly came from you. This is what public-key cryptography, which SSH uses, helps achieve.

### The Analogy: A Padlock and Its Key

Let's use a common analogy:

* **Public Key \= A Padlock (unlocked, with its unique keyhole)**  
* **Private Key \= The ONLY Key that can open that padlock**

### 1\. The **Public Key**

* **What it is:** A cryptographic string of characters that you **can safely share with anyone**. It's like giving everyone a copy of an unlocked padlock that only *you* have the key for.  
* **What it's used for (mainly):**  
  * **Encryption:** Anyone with your public key can encrypt a message (or create a "challenge") that *only* you (with your private key) can decrypt.  
  * **Verification/Authentication:** When you try to log into a server, the server uses your public key to verify that you are who you claim to be, by challenging you to "sign" something that only your private key can do.  
* **Where it lives:**  
  * On the **server** you want to connect to (e.g., your Google Cloud VM). On Linux, it's typically stored in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file within your user's home directory.  
  * (Less common for direct SSH) You *could* theoretically keep a copy on your local machine, but it's not strictly necessary for the SSH connection itself.  
* **Format:** Looks something like `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ... your_username@your_machine`

### 2\. The **Private Key**

* **What it is:** A cryptographic string of characters that you **must keep absolutely secret and secure**. It's like the *only* key that can open the padlock. If someone gets your private key, they can impersonate you.  
* **What it's used for (mainly):**  
  * **Decryption:** It's the only key that can decrypt messages encrypted with its corresponding public key.  
  * **Signing:** It's used to "sign" data, proving that you are the legitimate owner of the key pair.  
* **Where it lives:**  
  * **Only on your local machine** (the client machine from which you are initiating the SSH connection).  
  * It's typically stored in the `~/.ssh/` directory (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/google_compute_engine`).  
* **Security:**  
  * It should have strict file permissions (readable only by your user, e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`).  
  * It's highly recommended to protect it with a **passphrase** (a password) when you generate it. This adds an extra layer of security, so even if someone steals your private key file, they can't use it without knowing the passphrase.

### SSH Key Authentication (Refined Explanation)

1. **Generate Keys (Local Machine):**  
     
   * You generate a `private_key` and `public_key` pair on your local machine.

   

2. **Deploy Public Key (Server):**  
     
   * You copy your `public_key` to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

   

3. **Client Initiates Connection (Local Machine):**  
     
   * Your SSH client tries to connect to the server and says, "Hi, I'm `your_username`, and I'd like to authenticate using this public key of mine." It sends its public key to the server.

   

4. **Server's Challenge:**  
     
   * The server receives your public key.  
   * It checks if this public key is in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for `your_username`. If it is, the server trusts that this public key belongs to the legitimate user.  
   * The server then generates a **random, unique piece of data** (a "challenge" or "nonce"). This challenge is *not* encrypted using your public key. It's just a random string.  
   * The server then uses *another unique piece of information* – a **session ID** (a hash of various session parameters established during the initial handshake, known to both client and server).  
   * The server then instructs the client to prove it possesses the private key for the public key it just presented, by signing a combination of this random challenge and the session ID.

   

5. **Client's Response (Proof of Possession):**  
     
   * The local SSH client receives the random challenge and the session ID from the server.  
   * It takes these two pieces of information (the random challenge and the session ID) and creates a **hash** of them.  
   * Then, it uses its **private key to "sign" this hash.** This "signing" process is a cryptographic operation that uses the private key to create a unique signature of the data. It's *not* encryption in the sense of making the original data unreadable; rather, it creates a verifiable fingerprint.  
   * The client sends this **digital signature** (and *not* the original decrypted challenge or hash) back to the server.

   

6. **Server's Verification:**  
     
   * The server receives the digital signature from the client.  
   * It recalculates the hash of its own random challenge and the session ID (because it knows both).  
   * It then uses the *client's public key* (which it already has from step 2\) to **verify the digital signature**.  
   * If the signature is valid, it proves that the client possessed the corresponding private key (because only the matching private key could have produced that specific signature for that specific hash).  
   * The server authenticates the user, and the SSH session is established.

**Crucially, your private key is *never* sent over the network.** Only the results of operations performed with your private key are exchanged, proving your identity without ever exposing your secret.

This system is much more secure than passwords because:

* Keys are much longer and more complex than typical passwords.  
* They are resistant to brute-force attacks.  
* Your private key never leaves your local machine.  
* Even if the server is compromised, your private key (and thus access to *other* servers) remains secure, provided the private key wasn't on the compromised server itself.

## Encryption vs user authentication. 

Many articles describes ssh as another process as

* server encrypt random data using public key,   
* then client side decrypt data using private key. 

This **is not used** in user authentication, but used in sending secure message from server to client side.  If client decrypt the data and send the plain data to server to authenticate its identity. There is risk of others intercept the plain data message and impersonate client later (by reusing the data). 

In contrast, in the user authentication we described above, the data sent from client is a digital signature generated (with session id information). That only server cares to decrypt/verify signing using public key. If someone try to steal this client sent  digital signature, it’s not useful. As it is used to verify current session.
