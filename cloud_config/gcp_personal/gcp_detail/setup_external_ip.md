# Overview 

Notes about why and how setting up persistent external ip.


We need to obtain static external ip address to make machine using same external ip after stop and restart.  

**Note: after enable os-login and using proxy command to login, static ip address seems not necessary, but itâ€™s very low cost, I enable it anyway.**

You're asking about reserving a **static external IP address** in Google Cloud. This is a crucial step if you need your VM's public IP address to remain constant, even if you stop and start the VM, or even if you delete the VM and recreate it (though you'd have to reassign the IP in the latter case).

By default, VMs are assigned an **ephemeral external IP address**, which changes if the VM is stopped/started or deleted.

Here's how to reserve a static external IP address and assign it to your VM, step-by-step:

### Method 1: Reserve and Assign During VM Creation (Easiest)

This is the most straightforward way if you're creating a new VM.

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**  
     
   * Navigate to **Compute Engine \> VM instances**.  
   * Click **"CREATE INSTANCE"**.

   

2. **Configure your VM as usual.** Fill in the desired name, region, zone, machine type, boot disk, etc.  
     
3. **Network Interface Configuration:**  
     
   * Scroll down to the **"Advanced options"** section (usually under "Identity and API access" or "Management, security, disks, networking").  
   * Click on **"Networking"**.  
   * Under "Network interfaces," click on the **default interface** (usually named `nic0`).

   

4. **External IP Address Settings:**  
     
   * In the "External IP" dropdown, instead of `Ephemeral (Automatic)`, select **"Create IP address"**.

   

5. **Name and Reserve the IP:**  
     
   * A "Reserve a new static external IP address" dialog will appear.  
   * **Name:** Give your static IP address a meaningful name (e.g., `my-dev-vm-static-ip`, `web-server-public-ip`).  
   * **Description (Optional):** Add a description.  
   * Click **"RESERVE"**.

   

6. **Confirm and Create VM:**  
     
   * The newly reserved static IP address will now be selected in the dropdown.  
   * Click **"Done"** for the network interface.  
   * Click **"CREATE"** to create your VM.

The VM will now be assigned this static external IP address, and it will persist.

### Method 2: Reserve a New IP and Assign to an Existing VM

If you already have a VM running (or stopped) with an ephemeral IP, you can detach its current IP and assign a new static one.

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**  
     
   * Navigate to **VPC network \> IP addresses**.  
   * You'll see a list of your existing external IP addresses. Ephemeral IPs will have `Type: Ephemeral`.

   

2. **Reserve a New Static IP Address:**  
     
   * Click **"RESERVE EXTERNAL STATIC ADDRESS"** at the top.  
   * **Name:** Give it a meaningful name (e.g., `my-existing-vm-static-ip`).  
   * **Description (Optional):**  
   * **Network Tier (Optional):** Standard or Premium. Premium is default and offers better performance/reliability but might cost slightly more.  
   * **IP version:** IPv4 (most common) or IPv6.  
   * **Type:** Regional (most common, for use with VMs in a specific region) or Global (for use with Global Load Balancers). For a single VM, choose **Regional**.  
   * **Region:** Select the region where your VM is located. **This is critical: the static IP must be in the same region as your VM.**  
   * Click **"RESERVE"**.

   

3. **Assign the Static IP to your VM:**  
     
   * After the IP address is reserved, you'll see it in the list of IP addresses. It will have `Type: Static` and `Attached to: None` (initially).  
   * Locate the newly reserved static IP in the list.  
   * Click the **three vertical dots (Actions menu)** next to it.  
   * Select **"Change attachment"**.  
   * In the "Attach external IP address" dialog:  
     * **Instance:** Select your VM instance from the dropdown.  
     * **Network interface:** Select the network interface (usually `nic0`).  
   * Click **"ATTACH"**.

   

4. **Confirm:**  
     
   * Go back to **Compute Engine \> VM instances**.  
   * Your VM's external IP address should now display the static IP you just reserved and attached.

### Method 3: Using `gcloud` CLI (Recommended for Automation/Command Line Users)

This is the fastest way if you prefer the terminal.

1. **Reserve the static IP address:**  
     
   gcloud compute addresses create YOUR\_STATIC\_IP\_NAME \\  
     
       \--region=YOUR\_VM\_REGION \\  
     
       \--project=YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID  
     
   * Replace `YOUR_STATIC_IP_NAME` (e.g., `my-dev-vm-static-ip`).  
   * Replace `YOUR_VM_REGION` (e.g., `us-central1`). **Note: This is the region, not the zone.**  
   * Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`.

   

   This command will output the IP address that was reserved. Make a note of it.

   

2. **Assign the static IP to your existing VM:**  
     
   gcloud compute instances update YOUR\_VM\_NAME \\  
     
       \--zone=YOUR\_VM\_ZONE \\  
     
       \--network-interface=nic0,address=YOUR\_STATIC\_IP\_NAME\_OR\_ADDRESS \\  
     
       \--project=YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID  
     
   * Replace `YOUR_VM_NAME` (e.g., `my-dev-vm`).  
   * Replace `YOUR_VM_ZONE` (e.g., `us-central1-a`).  
   * Replace `YOUR_STATIC_IP_NAME_OR_ADDRESS` with either the *name* you gave the static IP in step 1 (`my-dev-vm-static-ip`) or the actual IP address (e.g., `34.123.45.67`). Using the name is generally more robust.  
   * Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`.

   

   *Note: If your VM is running, this command might briefly restart its network interface.*

### Key Considerations for Static External IP Addresses:

* **Cost:** Static external IP addresses incur a small cost, even if they are not attached to a running VM. If they *are* attached to a running VM, the cost is typically lower or included in the VM's billing, depending on whether it's a Premium or Standard Tier IP and your usage. Always check the official Google Cloud pricing for the most accurate current rates.  
* **Region:** A static external IP address is **regional**. It can only be assigned to a VM instance located in the *same region*.  
* **Detaching:** You can detach a static IP from a VM. It will then revert to an unattached static IP address, ready to be assigned to another VM in the same region.  
* **Deletion:** When you no longer need a static IP address, make sure to **release/delete it** from the VPC network \> IP addresses page to stop incurring charges.

Reserving a static IP is essential for use cases like:

* Running public-facing web servers with consistent DNS records.  
* Allowlisting IP addresses in external services.  
* Reliable SSH access where you always want to connect to the same IP.
