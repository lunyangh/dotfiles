# Ansible Playbook Syntax: A Detailed Guide

This guide provides a detailed reference to the structure, syntax, and common keywords used in Ansible playbooks. An Ansible playbook is a **YAML** file that describes a set of tasks to be executed on remote servers. The goal of a playbook is to provide a simple, human-readable, and **idempotent** way to manage system configurations.

-----

## Core Structure: Playbook \> Play \> Task

An Ansible playbook has a simple hierarchy. Understanding this structure is the first step to writing effective playbooks.

  * **Playbook**: The entire `.yml` file. It can contain one or more plays.
  * **Play**: A set of tasks that run against a specific group of servers defined in your inventory.
  * **Task**: A single action to be performed, like installing a package or copying a file.

### Annotated Example

```yaml
---
# The file starts with ---
# This marks the beginning of the first PLAY in the playbook
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  # This is the list of TASKS to be executed in this play
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure nginx is installed
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Ensure nginx is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

## Play-Level Keywords

These directives are defined at the start of a play and apply to all tasks within that play.

### `name`

A human-readable string describing the goal of the play. It's used for documentation and appears in the command-line output.

  * **Example**: `name: Configure database servers`

### `hosts`

Specifies which servers from your inventory file to target.

  * **`all`**: Targets every host in the inventory.
  * **Group Name**: Targets all hosts within a specific group (e.g., `webservers`).
  * **Example**:
    ````ini
    # inventory.ini
    [webservers]
    192.168.1.10
    192.168.1.11
    ```yaml
    # playbook.yml
    hosts: webservers
    ````

### `become`

Controls privilege escalation. `become: yes` tells Ansible to use `sudo` (by default) to execute tasks.

  * **Example**: `become: yes`

### `vars`

Defines variables that can be used throughout the play.

  * **Example**:
    ```yaml
    vars:
      package_name: apache2
      service_name: apache2

    tasks:
      - name: Install package
        ansible.builtin.apt:
          name: "{{ package_name }}" # Use variables with {{ }}
          state: present
    ```

-----

## Task-Level Keywords

These are defined for each individual task.

### `name`

A human-readable description for the task. This is what's printed to the terminal as the playbook runs, making it easy to track progress.

### Module

The core of a task. It's the tool that performs the action. Ansible has thousands of modules.

  * **`ansible.builtin.apt`**: Manages packages on Debian/Ubuntu.
  * **`ansible.builtin.copy`**: Copies files from the control node to the target.
  * **`ansible.builtin.file`**: Sets permissions, creates directories/symlinks, or deletes files.
  * **`ansible.builtin.shell`**: Executes a command in the target's shell.
  * **`ansible.builtin.service`**: Manages services (start, stop, restart).

-----

## Conditional and Control Flow Keywords

These keywords give your playbook intelligence, allowing it to react to the state of the system.

### `register`

Saves the output of a task into a variable. This is essential for making decisions based on a task's result.

  * **How it works**: When a task completes, `register` captures its return data (like standard output, error codes, and module-specific JSON data) into a variable.
  * **Example**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Check if a file exists
      ansible.builtin.stat:
        path: /etc/my-app/config.conf
      register: config_file_stats

    - name: Show the registered variable content
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: config_file_stats
    ```
    The `debug` task would print a JSON object containing information about the file, including a boolean `config_file_stats.stat.exists`.

### `when`

The "if" statement of Ansible. It runs a task only if a condition is true. It's often used with variables from a `register` clause.

  * **How it works**: Before executing the task, Ansible evaluates the `when` expression. If it's true, the task runs. If false, the task is skipped.
  * **Example**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Copy config file only if it doesn't exist
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: files/config.conf
        dest: /etc/my-app/config.conf
      when: not config_file_stats.stat.exists
    ```

### `changed_when`

Overrides Ansible's default logic for whether a task has "changed" the system. This is useful for cleaning up command output.

  * **How it works**: Some commands always report a change, even if they didn't alter the system's configuration (e.g., `apt update`). `changed_when: false` tells Ansible to report the task as `ok` (green) instead of `changed` (yellow) in these cases.
  * **Example**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Update apt package cache
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        update_cache: yes
      changed_when: false # This task will never be yellow
    ```

### `args` and `creates`

A common and concise shortcut for making shell commands idempotent.

  * **How it works**: The `creates` parameter (passed under `args`) specifies a file path. Before running the `shell` or `command` module, Ansible checks if that file already exists. If it does, the entire task is skipped. This is perfect for installation scripts that create a binary or a marker file upon completion.
  * **Example**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Install zoxide via script
      ansible.builtin.shell: >
        curl -sSfL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh) | sh
      args:
        # This whole task is skipped if the zoxide binary already exists
        creates: "/home/{{ ansible_user }}/.local/bin/zoxide"
    ```

### `loop`

Repeats a task multiple times with different values. This helps avoid writing repetitive tasks.

  * **How it works**: The `loop` keyword takes a list of items. The task will be executed once for each item in the list. The current item is available through the special variable `item`.
  * **Example**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Install a list of common packages
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - htop
        - vim
        - curl
        - tree
    ```
